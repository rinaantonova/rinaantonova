{Clock shows h hours, m minutes and s seconds after midnight.

Your task is to write a function which returns the time since midnight in milliseconds.

Example:
h = 0
m = 1
s = 1

result = 61000
Input constraints:

0 <= h <= 23
0 <= m <= 59
0 <= s <= 59






program time;
uses crt;
  var
        h, m, s, result : longint;
begin
  clrscr;
  writeln('enter time ');
  readln(h, m, s);

        result := h * 3600000 + m * 60000 + s * 1000;
  
  writeln ('unsatisfied ', result);
end.
