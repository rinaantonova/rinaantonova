{Jenny has written a function that returns a greeting for a user.
However, she's in love with Johnny, and would like to greet him slightly different.
She added a special case to her function, but she made a mistake.}




program Jennyssecretmessage;
uses crt;
  var 
        a : string;
        
begin
  clrscr;
  writeln('enter your name ');
  readln(a);
    
        if a = 'igoresha' then
            writeln('hello ', a, ' my love')
        else 
            writeln('hello ', a);
    
    
end.
